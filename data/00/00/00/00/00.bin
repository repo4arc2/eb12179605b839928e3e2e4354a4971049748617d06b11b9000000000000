It must be so exhausting.

157
00:11:43,541 --> 00:11:46,208
I'll admit you had me fooled there
for a minute.

158
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:49,458
Or did you get a little real?

159
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:54,833
Did Judge Renslayer really feel betrayed
by her beloved TVA?

160
00:11:54,916 --> 00:11:58,916
Why don't you come back out
and we can talk about it?

161
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,791
Sure. Just tell everyone else to piss off
and we can settle this between us.

everything proceeded correctly,

Take no offense, my friends,

00:14:06,708 --> 00:14:10,833
but blades are worthless
in the face of a Loki sorcery.

197

even the Mad Titan believed it.

Then hid as inanimate debris.

202
00:14:32,208 --> 00:14:35,208
After I faked my death,
I simply drifted in space.

203
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:38,208
Away from Thor, away from everything.

204
00:14:39,125 --> 00:14:41,500
Thought about the universe
and my place in it,

205
00:14:41,583 --> 00:14:44,291
and it occurred to me
that everywhere I went,

206
00:14:44,375 --> 00:14:45,875
only pain followed.

207
00:14:46,416 --> 00:14:49,500
So I removed myself from the equation,

208
00:14:49,583 --> 00:14:53,750
landed on a remote planet
and stayed there in isolation, in solitude

209
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:57,750
for a long, long time.

210
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,041
How did the TVA find you?

211
00:15:05,041 --> 00:15:06,041
I got lonely.

(CHUCKLES)

213
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:12,791
To tell you the truth,
I missed my brother,

214
00:15:12,875 --> 00:15:15,625
and I wondered if he missed me,
if anybody else did.

215
00:15:15,708 --> 00:15:18,833
But as soon as I took
my first steps to getting off the planet,

216
00:15:18,916 --> 00:15:20,375
the TVA arrived.

217
00:15:21,083 --> 00:15:24,083
Because we, my friends,
have but one part to play,

218

Nothing more.

220
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:34,750
The God of Outcasts.

221
00:15:41,875 --> 00:15:44,041
-I'm going.
-Going where?

222
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,916
Out of this place,
out of The Void, back to the TVA.

223
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,208
We're as good at escaping
as we are at surviving.

224
00:15:49,291 --> 00:15:51,000
That gives me a decent chance.

225

-You won't do either, you'll be murdered.
-Well, so be it.

-That was my destiny to begin with.
-You're different.

-Why?
-No, I'm not, you see?

228

I'm the same, really.
I'm the same as all of you.

-Oh, she is.

she's trying to take it down.

And she needs me.

is what keeps us here.

You hunted me like a dog.

314
00:22:20,166 --> 00:22:21,541
I'm sorry about that.

315
00:22:26,291 --> 00:22:29,333
When I pruned myself,
I thought I might be able to find Loki.

316
00:22:30,541 --> 00:22:33,708
That storm, that thing,
it's likely already got him.

317
00:22:33,791 --> 00:22:35,208
You really believe that?

318
00:22:35,291 --> 00:22:36,541
It doesn't matter.

319
00:22:39,083 --> 00:22:42,250
The only thing that matters now
is getting out of here

320
00:22:42,333 --> 00:22:44,416
and finding out who's behind all of this.

321
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:46,958
Great. How do we do that?

322
00:22:47,041 --> 00:22:48,208
We turn around.

323
00:22:49,291 --> 00:22:52,750
Turn around?
What, and go back to the angry cloud?

324
00:22:52,833 --> 00:22:55,583
Yeah. I think it might be the answer.

325
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:57,750
We're going back to it.

326
00:23:08,791 --> 00:23:13,041
CLASSIC LOKI: I have to say, it feels odd
walking toward the gargantuan creature.

327
00:23:13,708 --> 00:23:15,375
Do you have a plan of action?

328
00:23:15,458 --> 00:23:19,333
Get inside, find its heart
or brain or whatever,

329
00:23:19,416 --> 00:23:22,416
-and then, you know, do it in.
-KID LOKI: I mean...

330
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:25,375
Just because it's not complicated
doesn't mean it's bad.

331
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:28,166
It also doesn't mean it's good.

332
00:23:28,666 --> 00:23:31,833
-(GROWLS)
-See? He's on board.

333
00:23:31,916 --> 00:23:34,041
He's praying.
He thinks we're going to die.

334
00:23:42,791 --> 00:23:44,500
SAILOR: All hands to battle stations!

335
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:49,625
Alioth is like any animal.

336
00:23:49,708 --> 00:23:51,750
He'll go after the big meal first.

337
00:23:53,833 --> 00:23:57,625
And while he's busy with that,
we can sneak around the back and...

338
00:23:57,750 --> 00:24:00,125
(ALIOTH BELLOWS)

00:24:07,666 --> 00:24:08,916

(GRUNTS, SCREAMS)

342
00:24:24,041 --> 00:24:26,416
(PANTING) Okay.

343
00:24:27,166 --> 00:24:28,166
Maybe we, uh...

344
00:24:29,458 --> 00:24:31,416
think a bit more about this, huh?

345
00:24:33,666 --> 00:24:34,875
Car.

346
00:24:35,458 --> 00:24:37,125
-What?
-Along the horizon.

347
00:24:37,208 --> 00:24:38,208
LOKI: Is that bad?

348
00:24:38,291 --> 00:24:40,833
KID LOKI: Well, usually means
cannibalistic marauders

349
00:24:40,916 --> 00:24:42,416
or cannibalistic pirates.

350
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:43,750
Delightful.

351
00:24:45,541 --> 00:24:47,125
Now they're slowing down.

352
00:24:48,041 --> 00:24:50,291
-What are they doing?
-Just stay on guard.

353
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Sylvie.

354
00:24:57,041 --> 00:25:00,041
I don't understand.
Is he a coward or was he being brave?

355
00:25:00,125 --> 00:25:02,125
-I'm not too sure.
-Come on.

356
00:25:10,166 --> 00:25:11,166
You're alive.

357
00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:12,916
What happened? You okay?

358
00:25:14,083 --> 00:25:15,333
Mobius!

359
00:25:16,791 --> 00:25:19,458
-How did you...
-We thought you could do with some backup.

360
00:25:23,625 --> 00:25:26,416
Oh, no, wait, wait, wait,
these are my friends.

361
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:29,583
Well, they're, um... How best to put this?

362
00:25:30,125 --> 00:25:33,291
Us as a child, us in the future,

363
00:25:33,375 --> 00:25:37,000
and us as an alligator.

364
00:25:38,708 --> 00:25:40,500
It's best not to question it.

365
00:25:40,583 --> 00:25:42,625
You throw a rock out here, you hit a Loki.

366
00:25:42,708 --> 00:25:45,833
So you're all after
the giant cloud monster, too, then?

367
00:25:45,916 --> 00:25:48,791
Well, we haven't decided
how we're going to kill it, but...

368
00:25:48,875 --> 00:25:51,666
-Come again? Kill it?
-Yes, we're gonna kill Alioth.

369
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:53,375
Oh, my God. That was your plan.

370
00:25:53,458 --> 00:25:55,208
-Yeah.
-And you went along with it?

371
00:25:55,291 --> 00:25:57,000
-KID LOKI: I had my doubts.
-Probably unsafe.

372
00:25:57,083 --> 00:25:59,416
All right, well, what's your plan, then?

373
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:03,625
I think the person we're after
is beyond The Void at the end of time.

374
00:26:03,708 --> 00:26:04,708
And if they are,

375
00:26:04,791 --> 00:26:08,125
that thing is just their guard dog
protecting the only way in.

376
00:26:08,208 --> 00:26:11,375
Okay, so, um, how do we get past
the guard dog?

377
00:26:11,458 --> 00:26:12,458
I'm gonna enchant it.

378
00:26:13,208 --> 00:26:14,625
(LAUGHING)

379
00:26:16,458 --> 00:26:18,208
-That's insane, right?
-As insane as what?

380
00:26:18,291 --> 00:26:20,083
-Paper-cutting a cloud to death?
-Listen,

381
00:26:20,166 --> 00:26:23,583
-I've been down here longer than you...
-I'm going to enchant it.

382
00:26:25,583 --> 00:26:26,833
She's pretty confident.

383
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:37,458
Leave us.

384
00:27:08,708 --> 00:27:10,666
Why am I locked in here?

385
00:27:12,375 --> 00:27:13,958
You freed the Variant.

386
00:27:14,541 --> 00:27:17,875
-You were disloyal to the TVA.
-Disloyal?

387
00:27:17,958 --> 00:27:21,291
-Did you think you'd escape punishment?
-Disloyal to who?

388
00:27:23,041 --> 00:27:25,750
You were in the Time-Keepers' chambers.
They weren't real.

389
00:27:25,833 --> 00:27:27,416
And why does that change anything?

390
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:29,000
That changes everything!

391
00:27:29,791 --> 00:27:31,333
The people need to know the truth.

392
00:27:31,416 --> 00:27:33,333
No, the TVA needs stability.

393
00:27:33,416 --> 00:27:36,208
And until we figure out what's going on,
that is what it will get.

394
00:27:38,333 --> 00:27:41,500
So you need to tell me everything.

395
00:27:42,875 --> 00:27:45,125
What exactly do you want from me?

396
00:27:47,166 --> 00:27:49,166
You had a link with the Variant.

397
00:27:50,041 --> 00:27:52,000
I want you to tell me what drives her.

398
00:27:52,083 --> 00:27:53,791
Revenge drives her.

399
00:27:55,416 --> 00:27:57,291
Killing the Time-Keepers.

400
00:27:57,833 --> 00:28:00,625
But they turned out to be fake,
in case you forgot.

401
00:28:01,625 --> 00:28:04,000
So she'll be searching
for whomever created them.

402
00:28:10,916 --> 00:28:12,166
(SCOFFS)

403
00:28:13,625 --> 00:28:17,791
This isn't about protecting
the TVA at all, is it?

404
00:28:20,125 --> 00:28:23,166
You just want to find
whoever is behind all of this, too.

405
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,208
(CHUCKLES)

406
00:28:29,375 --> 00:28:31,250
You'll never find them.

407
00:28:31,333 --> 00:28:33,208
Not before she does.

408
00:28:33,291 --> 00:28:34,291
And why is that?

409
00:28:36,041 --> 00:28:37,375
You only want it.

410
00:28:40,833 --> 00:28:42,166
She needs it.

411
00:28:51,625 --> 00:28:53,083
(BEEPING)

00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,083
<i>Hey, y'all.</i>

413
00:28:55,166 --> 00:28:57,333
I need all the files
on the founding of the TVA.

414
00:28:57,416 --> 00:28:59,291
Everything from the beginning of time.

415
00:28:59,375 --> 00:29:01,083
<i>Well, that's a mighty tall order.</i>

416
00:29:01,166 --> 00:29:03,875
Whoever created this place is in danger.

417
00:29:03,958 --> 00:29:05,083
I need to find them.

418
00:29:05,583 --> 00:29:07,666
<i>Okay. Right away, ma'am.</i>

MOBIUS: I mean,
the TVA arrested a lot of Lokis,

421
00:29:25,291 --> 00:29:28,375
but, no, I don't remember an alligator.

422
00:29:28,958 --> 00:29:31,041
I mean, who's to say
he's even a Loki Variant?

423
00:29:33,041 --> 00:29:34,500
He is green, isn't he?

424
00:29:34,583 --> 00:29:36,041
I don't know, he could be lying.

425
00:29:36,125 --> 00:29:39,500
The long con. Of course, that just
makes him more likely to be a Loki.

426
00:29:40,375 --> 00:29:44,375
It's always the game within the game
with you guys, which I respect.

427
00:29:46,041 --> 00:29:47,041
KID LOKI: Mobius,

428
00:29:47,875 --> 00:29:50,791
assuming you do get back to the TVA,

429
00:29:51,875 --> 00:29:54,041
what exactly are you
getting yourself into?

430
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:58,666
I don't know.

431
00:29:59,625 --> 00:30:02,916
I'd like to let people know the truth.

432
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,250
So just like that,
you're turning on the very thing

433
00:30:05,333 --> 00:30:06,625
you devoted your life to.

434
00:30:07,333 --> 00:30:09,333
Well, it's never too late to change.

435
00:30:12,166 --> 00:30:14,166
I hope they know what they're doing.

436
00:30:17,875 --> 00:30:19,458
Mobius isn't so bad.

437
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:22,750
Or so good.

438
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:25,208
I think that's why we get along.

439
00:30:28,708 --> 00:30:29,916
He cares about you.

440
00:30:39,083 --> 00:30:41,125
-It's cold.
-Mmm-hmm.

441
00:30:52,833 --> 00:30:54,541
I could conjure one for you, if you like.

442
00:30:56,541 --> 00:30:59,166
You could conjure me a new outfit.

443
00:30:59,250 --> 00:31:01,666
You have no idea how uncomfortable
something like this is.

444
00:31:10,666 --> 00:31:11,666
So...

445
00:31:12,291 --> 00:31:17,125
Mobius and his theory about...

446
00:31:17,208 --> 00:31:19,291
Right, right. About our nexus event.

447
00:31:19,375 --> 00:31:22,041
-Total rubbish, right?
-Absolutely. Of course. I mean...

448
00:31:22,125 --> 00:31:24,208
I don't mean that it wasn't a nice moment.

449
00:31:24,291 --> 00:31:26,250
No, it was great. It was really nice.

450
00:31:26,333 --> 00:31:28,458
It just sounds like another TVA lie.

451
00:31:28,541 --> 00:31:32,583
A hundred percent.
I mean, totally. Yeah.

452
00:31:40,583 --> 00:31:42,041
I don't know how to do this.

453
00:31:42,875 --> 00:31:44,416
I don't even know what we're doing.

454
00:31:46,916 --> 00:31:49,375
I don't have friends.

455
00:31:52,166 --> 00:31:53,166
I don't have...

456
00:31:56,333 --> 00:31:57,541
anyone.

457
00:31:58,041 --> 00:31:59,041
Well...

458
00:31:59,708 --> 00:32:01,541
there are more important things, right?

459
00:32:02,250 --> 00:32:05,375
Right? Yeah.
Like bringing down the TVA.

460
00:32:05,458 --> 00:32:07,000
Saving the universe, even.

461
00:32:07,083 --> 00:32:09,791
Well, there's no need to be dramatic,
but, yeah, kind of.

462
00:32:28,291 --> 00:32:29,500
It's not very snuggly.

463
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:32,125
-(CHUCKLING) Okay.
-Is it a tablecloth?

464
00:32:32,208 --> 00:32:33,958
No, it's a blanket.

465
00:32:37,666 --> 00:32:38,666
Thank you.

466
00:32:42,125 --> 00:32:43,416
My pleasure.

467
00:32:55,875 --> 00:32:59,125
How do I know that, in the final moments,
you won't betray me?

468
00:32:59,958 --> 00:33:01,250
Listen, Sylvie, I...

469
00:33:03,916 --> 00:33:05,500
(SIGHS DEEPLY)

470
00:33:05,666 --> 00:33:07,583
I betrayed everyone who ever loved me.

471
00:33:08,791 --> 00:33:11,041

It was brief,
but I caught a glimpse of something,

501
00:35:13,375 --> 00:35:16,458
and I think if I can get
close enough to it, I can enchant it,

502
00:35:16,541 --> 00:35:19,416
and it's gonna take me
